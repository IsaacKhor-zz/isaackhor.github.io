		<div class="article-text">
		<p>There has recently been talk amongst the school about starting a Model United Nations programme. As perhaps the only person at the school that has any experience with this area, I feel an obligation to chime in and give my two cents.</p>

<p>First and foremost, you must know what MUN is <em>not</em>. It is <em>not</em> a chance to debate policy. It is <em>not</em> a simulation of the actual UN sitting in NYC. It is <em>not</em> a forum where people come together to have intellectual discussions on pressing political issues.</p>

<p>What MUN <em>is</em>, however, is a place where you get to practise your skills in <em>politics</em>. It is a forum where you see how the house of cards that is politics play out. This is where, if you are observant, you learn the skills that will aid you in becoming a good politician: behind-the-scenes bargaining, mass-persuasion, power blocs, identification of the keys figures and negotiating with them, speeches that persuade by <em>words</em>, not logic, and so much more.</p>

<p>If you are going to MUN to hone your debating skills, turn back now. That is the last thing that you will find. MUN is a byzantine collection of rules and tradition that is in no way conducive of debates. You, if you have points to make and arguments to rebut, will find yourself unable to do either. MUN is <em>not</em> a forum of debate. You must get your talking done <em>through other people</em>, which is where the game of politics comes into play.</p>

<p>If you are going to MUN to see what the actual UN is like, you too should turn back now. Just compare footage of the UN General Assembly meetings with any MUN footage you can find. Those two things are not the same. The actual UN&rsquo;s goal is <em>not</em> to pass more resolutions since they all know that those don&rsquo;t do anything. However, passing resolutions <em>is</em> the ultimate goal for a MUN conference; and because of that, the structure and politics of these two organisations play out very differently.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about what happens in a MUN conference. As I said, the ultimate goal here is to pass resolutions. To do that, you need a majority vote (unlike the UN where most resolutions are passed by consensus), and to get those votes, politics needs to happen.</p>

<p>The primary way of changing people&rsquo;s mind on voting for or against your resolution is speeches. A person goes up to the podium, gives a speech, and answers some questions. However, one man cannot pass resolutions alone. The chair won&rsquo;t let you speak that many times. This is why I said that you need to speak <em>through other people</em>.</p>

<p>This is where all that politics that I talked about comes into play: some people are better persuaders than others. These are the individuals that have the ability to sway many voters to their side. These are the individuals that give 95% of the speeches, ask the majority of questions, and exert the most influence over their mindless peers.</p>

<p>If you are observant, you will see these persuaders forming alliances early in the conference. Some are not aware that they are doing so, due to their innate ability to play the game of politics, but some are much more deliberate, like me. These alliances are not formal: most times, there isn&rsquo;t even a verbal agreement. It&rsquo;s a non-explicit mutual understanding that, instead of doing their best to bring you down, they will assist or at the very least not actively hinder you in passing your resolution.</p>

<p>In MUN, most voters are merely mindless automatons. They are passive agents, a pawn in the game of Chess the select few persuaders are playing. Ask any experienced MUN-er about their experience at MUN, at the first thing you will find out is that 10% of the speakers give 90% of the speeches and hold 99% of the power. Most voters do not evaluate the merits of both sides of the resolution and vote by the rules of logic; most are bound by the limits of human psychology and act accordingly. You win votes by <em>sounding</em> right, not by <em>being</em> right. Of course, in order to fight the battle with other persuaders, logic is a tool that can make your opponent <em>sound</em> like they don&rsquo;t know what they are doing. Here lies the most important distinction: logic is not <em>itself</em> the component that persuades, it is the <em>illusion</em> it gives of authority and correctness that persuades. Logic doesn&rsquo;t persuade, <em>words</em> persuade.</p>

<p>The mindless automaton theory only applies to large committees, in smaller committees, where schools send their veterans, the tools of persuasion no longer applies, which in turn increases the importance of alliances and politics. However, as a newcomer, your chances of making it into the smaller elite committees are close to nil, mainly due to your lack of political experience, so you need not concern yourself with them for now.</p>

<p>If you find yourself disgusted at the nature of human psychology and the game of politics, MUN will not suit you well, unless you intend on playing the part of the mindless automaton. If you think you will enjoy the mindless automaton experience, by all means, join MUN. If you can, try to pay attention to the game of politics and intrigue that is playing out around you; it may become useful if you decide to try playing the game.</p>

<p>If you find yourself excited at the idea of weaving political webs and playing the game of persuasion, MUN will suit you well. Once you see MUN for what it really is, instead of what it claims to be, it will become a very enjoyable experience. There is no thrill like realising that your plan to use the tools of persuasion actually sways others to your banner. In that case, I wish you the very best. Enjoy your time with the politics of MUN.</p>

			<span class="article-meta"><time datetime="2016-10-18">18 October 2016</time></span>
		</div>
		<div class="article-text">
		<p>Starting from today, I will be forcing myself to write an essay fortnightly in an effort to improve my writing. The contents of these essays will range wildly from programming to politics and philosophy.</p>

<p>These essays are meant to be for me and me only, hence the name: meditations, inspired by the Roman philosopher-king Marcus Aurelius&rsquo; untitled works commonly referred to as the <em>Meditations</em>. If you are reading this, I welcome your feedback, but please understand if nothing makes sense. They exist for the sole purpose of benefiting me.</p>

<p>Since my initial exposure to philosophy and scepticism, my worldview has been in a constant state of flux. My religious views have shifted from Christianity to agnosticism, then finally to atheism, which I still believe as of the time of writing; my philosophical outlook has shifted from a conservative Christian one taught by my parents to secular humanism to relativism finally to a blend between nihilism and some other beliefs that don&rsquo;t have specific labels.</p>

<p>Throughout all of this transition, I have never been able to form a full picture of my current beliefs. All of my beliefs are compartmentalised into their own little world with vague interactions with all others, where a grand unifying framework upon which all of them rest doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p>This complex system of individual beliefs without connection to others is a remnant of the slow and gradual development of these ideas over time, building upon several different sources at different points of my life. While meandering through the tomes of philosophical knowledge, I would occasionally stumble across an idea with which I agree or an argument that I found persuasive, and change my belief by a tiny bit.</p>

<p>Over time, my beliefs have fragmented into a thousand tiny kingdoms, each with their own system and customs, all standing alone, isolated from each other. Some ideas lie in conflict with each other, some stand alone in a corner, abstraction nowhere to be seen. Some are remnants of a long-gone age when my young, naive self found himself persuaded by long-forgotten arguments and changed his mind.</p>

<p>I feel like a tipping point has been reached; for too long have these isolated ideas stood by themselves, it is time for an attempt, however arduous and futile it may be, to reconcile these ideas on a larger scale, time for these ideas to form higher-level frameworks for which they can rest upon. My brain cannot simultaneously account for hundreds if not thousands of individual little pieces of information, they must be built into larger units that I can reason about.</p>

<p>To achieve this goal, I must begin by cataloguing what beliefs I hold. Hence the need for these essays: they provide a concrete means of listing in detail what I believe and how I got there (assuming I still remember the reasons), and from there, once I have a better understanding of the landscape of my brain, only can I begin restructuring and refactoring (it&rsquo;s a programming term; google it) said beliefs.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long this will take, nor do I know what the results of this journey will be. All I know is that my brain cannot simultaneously hold a thousand belief systems together, and that something must change so that I will not have to try. So begins a new chapter in my philosophical journey: a period of consolidation and reorganisation. Wish me luck.</p>

<p>My Original Oratory entry for the 2016 ISKL forensics competition, published here in its full glory. Yes, I know, it is really, really, really bad, but I&rsquo;m going to put it up here anyways for the sake of letting other people learn from my mistakes.</p>

<h2 id="daylight-saving-time">Daylight Saving Time</h2>

<p>Daylight saving time, making timezones confusing since 1916. If you are not familiar with it, daylight saving time is a weird ritual in which countries move their clocks forward sometime in the spring, only to move them back sometime in the fall. To the rest of the world that doesn’t participate in this biannual ritual of clock fiddling, it might seem like a baffling thing to do. After all, clocks are fine the way they are, why change them?</p>

<p>The original idea, proposed by George Hudson, had nothing to do with saving daylight and everything to do with catching butterflies. He thought that if clocks were shifted forward in the summer, he would get more time after work to indulge in his hobby of catching butterflies. Of course, “butterfly catching time” is not exactly a sexy name that will get you votes, so he renamed it daylight saving time and sold it as a way to conserve daylight.</p>

<p>However, Germany, the first country to implement the system, did so because they needed more coal to fuel their efforts in World War I. The reasoning is that if the population woke up later and slept later, they will use less artificial light, freeing up coal for the war.</p>

<p>While that might have worked in 1916, does it still work in the modern world of 2016? As it turns out, this is a surprisingly hard question to answer. There is no consensus in the scientific community, with some studies claiming it does save energy and some studies claiming the exact opposite. But, the studies all agree on one thing: how little energy you save or lose. It is not 10 percent, it’s not 5%, it’s 1 percent. 1 whole percent of an increase or decrease in your energy bill. That’s about 4 dollars annually, which is not even enough for a cup of coffee, so we might as well ignore it.</p>

<p>Since daylight saving time’s energy savings are nonexistent, and most people don’t care about catching butterflies, should we we keep the biannual ritual of clock fiddling around? Unlike the previous energy problem, the research on this is very clear: no, clock fiddling causes more problems that it solves, if it solves any at all.</p>

<p>The most obvious problem comes from sleep deprivation. Waking up an hour earlier generally causes you to sleep less, and sleep deprivation has been shown to lead to heart attacks and suicides. Researchers have found that in the days following the time change there is a 10 percent increase in heart attacks and suicides. We are literally killing people by fiddling with clocks.</p>

<p>Another problem comes from scheduling meetings across time zones. Let’s say that you want to plan a conference between New York, London, and Sydney, which will be fun because none of the three agree on when to start and end daylight saving time. During the spring, in the space of 3 weeks, New York is 5 hours behind London, then 4, then 5 hours again, depending on the week, Sydney is either 11, 10, or 9 hours away from New York, and Sydney is again either 16, 15, or 14 hours from London. I know, I wrote this myself, and even I am confused. And the whole thing will happen again, just in reverse, when autumn comes.</p>

<p>This is madness! It might have not mattered 100 years ago in the Dark Ages of no internet, but, in 2016, where thousands international meetings are planned every single day, shifting around time zones isn’t going to do anybody any favours.</p>

<p>At this point, you might be wondering: wait, so how does this daylight saving thing work? We remove an hour from the day in the spring and add an hour in the fall - but, what does it actually look like on my clock? I’m glad you asked, because the solution is very … clever. So clever, in fact, that no clocks on the planet can actually accomplish such a feat. Our excellent governments decided for some reason that the best way to remove an hour from the day is to skip 2 am. During the spring, the official clock will go 1:57, 1:58, 1:59, 3:00. During the fall, to add an hour to the day, 1 am is repeated, and the official clocks go 1:57, 1:58, 1:59, 1:00. Surely all clocks on the planet can achieve such an easy task. I don’t know about you, but I have never in my life seen the hour hand on my watch jump from 1 to 3. In fact, I am pretty sure that it can’t.</p>

<p>What then? The clock fiddling advocate tells us to replace all clocks with digital clocks that have wireless chips in them to connect to the internet to update their time. I am sure that you can find some flaws in this line of reasoning, like &ndash; how do you tell your clock your wifi password? You can’t expect a tiny computer to run on battery power for a whole year. So, who gets the power? Your phone or clock? I can go on forever about the problems, but I only have so much time. Unless they add an hour in the middle of my speech.</p>

<p>To review, daylight saving time saves almost no energy, causes sleep deprivation, causes more suicides, makes planning international meetings an absolute joy, terrorises the twenty-four hour day, and trashes the non-internet-savvy clock. This is why we should get rid of it, to make timezones normal and less confusing again. Let us restore the former glory of timezones as they were before that dreadful day in 1916. Thank you.</p>

			<span class="article-meta"><time datetime="2016-09-16">16 September 2016</time></span>

<p>Instead of doing my Calculus homework, I decided that it would be great idea to try setting up a custom domain for this website. Now that it is done, instead of doing said calculus homework, I&rsquo;m going to write about setting up the custom domain! (Yes, calculus homework is really boring.)</p>

<h3 id="buying-a-domain">Buying a Domain</h3>

<p>Buying a domain was pretty easy. I am using <a href="https://hover.com/">Hover</a> as my registrar, which was highly recommended by my friends. The domain costs $14/year. Yes, there are cheaper prices, but I think the extra dollar or two per year is worth the nice UI and support.</p>

<p>After creating A records pointing to Github&rsquo;s servers, and creating a CNAME file in Github, the DNS settings propagated to Google&rsquo;s DNS servers within a minute. Visiting <a href="https://isaackhor.com/">isaackhor.com</a> navigated to the right location. However, I noticed something :</p>

<p><img src="/img/setting-up-a-custom-domain-nossl.png" alt="Where's the SSL?" /></p>

<p>No HTTPS? Ok, I should be able to set a certificate somewhere&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-https">Setting up HTTPS</h3>

<p>Google told me that I can either have encryption, or a custom domain, but not both. However, Google also presented me with a workaround: use <a href="https://cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a>. So, that&rsquo;s exactly what I did. After configuring everything on CloudFlare, I spent the next 5 minutes doing this (what calculus homework? I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about):</p>

<pre><code>~$ dig isaackhor.com +nostats +nocomments +nocmd
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, if you have a custom, local DNS cache, you should disable it. It took me a few minutes to realise that this was happening:</p>

<pre><code>;; Query time: 8 msec
;; SERVER: 127.0.0.1#53(127.0.0.1)
;; WHEN: Fri Sep 16 17:58:47 2016
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 47
</code></pre>

<p>After changing DNS to 8.8.8.8, finally:</p>

<pre><code>~$ dig isaackhor.com

; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.8.3-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; isaackhor.com
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 49246
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 2, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;isaackhor.com.			IN	A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
isaackhor.com.		299	IN	A	104.27.147.99
isaackhor.com.		299	IN	A	104.27.146.99

;; Query time: 38 msec
;; SERVER: 8.8.8.8#53(8.8.8.8)
;; WHEN: Fri Sep 16 18:06:08 2016
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 63
</code></pre>

<p>Test isaackhor.com in the browser, everything works correctly. Final step: force all traffic to HTTPS:</p>

<p><img src="/img/setting-up-a-custom-domain-cloudflare-pagerule.png" alt="CloudFlare Page Rules" /></p>

<p>Test in Chrome, yep, HTTPS works:</p>

<p><img src="/img/setting-up-a-custom-domain-ssl.png" alt="HTTPS is working" /></p>

<p>Now, to get back to that calculus homework &hellip; wait &hellip; I can have custom email, don&rsquo;t I? Why don&rsquo;t I set it up right now?</p>

<p>To be continued &hellip;</p>

		<p>After endless hours of fiddling around with CSS and Hugo templates, this website finally looks half-decent! Let&rsquo;s just all pretend that the thing that used to be here never existed, and carry on with our day. I will write more about setting this place up later, I need to make sure deployment to Github Pages works correctly first.</p>
