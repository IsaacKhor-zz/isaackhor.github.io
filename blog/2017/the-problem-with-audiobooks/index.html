		<p>Audiobooks, in theory, are a great idea: have somebody read the thing you were going to read to yourself out loud, and you can listen to it while doing something else, like cooking, cleaning, etc.</p>

<p>This is the passive version of reading: information flows from the text into your brain, with no interruptions, and not requiring a lot of engagement from the reader. That, however, is not how <em>I</em> read.</p>

<p>When I read, I jump around. A lot. When I realise that the paragraph I am reading can be skipped, I do so. When I am confused, I jump back. I skim, jump forward, reread, jump back, pause to process the information, and much more.</p>

<p>Listening to the first 3 hours of <em>Guns, Germs, and Steel</em>, and then reading the second half, just made me realise how much I <em>skip</em> while reading a book, and how much I go back and reread, with pauses along the way to think about the author&rsquo;s arguments and see if they make sense.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that I consume all media at 2-4x speed, depending on the thing in question, and this book is no different. Most of the time, at 3x speed, the narrator is speaking at a comfortable pace for me. However, I have to listen to him read the parts that I would have skipped, which makes me stop paying attention and leaves me confused when I inevitably start paying attention, only to find the narrator somewhere completely new.</p>

<p>Pausing is also a pain with audiobooks. For most of the books I read, which are mostly the author trying to present an argument, which, at a glance, is about three quarters of my reading list, I need to pause frequently and think about the author&rsquo;s argument, and let myself have some time to digest it. The set pace of narration destroys my frequent reflections, and I have found that after 1 hour of GGS, or 3 hours into the book, I felt myself not really <em>understanding</em> the argument being presented. The last half of the book took me an hour to read, which tells me that it&rsquo;s not the <em>speed</em> that&rsquo;s the problem, it&rsquo;s the <em>manner</em> of information digestion.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that my time with audiobooks have ended; I will never again listen to audiobooks, for they do not accomplish the goal of reading books in the first place: to understand the author&rsquo;s argument and decide if it is valid. Reading words on a paper remains the only way to do so for now.</p>
