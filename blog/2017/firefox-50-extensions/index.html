<p>About four months after my switch to Firefox, my extensions situation seems to have finally stabilised. Thus, it&rsquo;s time to take a comprehensive inventory of my entire browser system, for the sake of documentation in case I need to set up this system again.</p>

<p>I hope to still be using this in a year, but with Firefox extensions, you will never know.</p>

<h2 id="ui-enhancements">UI Enhancements</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Tab Centre:</strong> Tabs laid out vertically makes much more sense that the default horizontal configuration. The main reason is that I don&rsquo;t like to have wide browser windows, since most webpages utilise <em>vertical</em> rather than <em>horizontal</em> space, and having tabs laid out vertically makes it easier for me to find everything anyways.</li>
<li><strong>Reddit Enhancement Suite:</strong> Self-explanatory. Browsing reddit without RES drives me insane.</li>
<li><strong>1Password:</strong> While not strictly a purely UI addon, I will include it here anyways. My username and password system is beyond the scope of this article; all you need to know is that everything is managed through 1Password (along with some scripts I hacked together).</li>
<li><strong>DevEdition theme enabler:</strong> The default theme looks ugly. What more can I say?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>uBlock Origin:</strong> Yes, I run an adblocker, and yes, it is not purely for privacy reasons. I used to use AdBlock, but as many others have discovered, uBlock is the best when it comes to CPU and memory usage.</li>
<li><strong>Ghostery:</strong> I am actually experimenting with removing Ghostery, since the things it blocks should already be included in uBlock, but it stays for now.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Destructing Cookies:</strong> I used to maintain a cookie whitelist, but I have found that to be <em>way</em> to much work; setting certain websites to have their cookies kept with SDC is a system that is just as practical and requires almost no work.</li>
<li><strong>NoScript:</strong> JavaScript-blocking is a must. I don&rsquo;t trust most websites enough to run their code on my machine, and most pages work just fine without JS anyways. I am pretty strict with enabling JavaScript, and even with that most websites still work just fine.</li>
<li><strong>Decentraleyes:</strong> This is a local CDN cache that requires very little maintenance, and is here for no reason other than it provides <em>some</em> protection against fingerprinting.</li>
<li><strong>Random Agent Spoofer:</strong> This extension, as it name suggests, spoofs the UserAgent that your browser sends; it is a great protection against browser fingerprinting. It also includes some options for countering other forms of fingerprinting, like disabling JS canvas support, some of which are enabled.</li>
<li><strong>HTTPS Everywhere:</strong> Despite my misgivings about the EFF, this remains a must-have extension, since I don&rsquo;t like MiTM attacks, and neither should you.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="utilities">Utilities</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Dorando keyconfig:</strong> This extension is for binding shortcuts to Firefox, since it uses a custom keyboard event-handling system that is opaque and extremely hard to configure. I have just recently started playing with Hammerspoon, and I am currently experimenting with removing this extension and migrating my shortcuts over to Hammerspoon.</li>
<li><strong>Test pilot:</strong> Dependency for Tab Center; I can&rsquo;t remove it even if I wanted to.</li>
<li><strong>Add-on Compatibility Reporter:</strong> Temporary while I puzzle over the migration to e10s.</li>
</ol>
