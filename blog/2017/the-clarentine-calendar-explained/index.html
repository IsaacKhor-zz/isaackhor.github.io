		<p>A note on notation: all numbers are in base-twelve unless it ends with a e, which means it is in decimal or base-ten.</p>

<p>The Clarentine Calendar that I recently published contains a number of &hellip; interesting &hellip; systems, the most notable of which is the usage of base-twelve and the ignoring of the conventional 265/365e year.</p>

<p>The reason for using duodecimal has been mentioned by many before me; I will not repeat them again.  If you are too lazy to find out, it basically boils down to composability.</p>

<p>The reason I didn&rsquo;t even try to incorporate the traditional 265 day cycle into the calendar is because it doesn&rsquo;t matter.  I don&rsquo;t care about needing the calendar to keep track of the seasons for me, which is, as far as I can tell, the main reason for a solar calendar in the first place.  If I needed to know the current season, I can always look out of the window, or in the case here in Malaysia, remain blissfully ignorant of any seasons at all.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t care how far along Earth is along its rotation around the Sun; I sleep just as well at night not knowing this information.  A rational system of dividing time matters far more to me.</p>

<p>The other notable feature of the calendar is its usage of <em>subdivisions</em>.  Subdivisions exist because of how I structure my life: I have certain tasks that I do every 3, 4, and 6 days, which are perfectly aligned with these subdivisions.  These are the fundamental units of time that I work with beyond the single day; it makes sense to incorporate them into my personal calendar as well.</p>

<p>The choice of the J2000 epoch was arbitrary; it&rsquo;s close enough to my lifetime to have the years in fairly low numbers, and has a nice compatibility with UTC that functions just like the Unix 1 Jan 1970e epoch.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still working on a better way to notate the difference between absolute and relative dates; adding a &lsquo;y&rsquo; in the middle of the string looks ugly.  However, I consider the overall <em>structure</em> of the calendar complete; the naming and some small details might change, but the overall layout of the calendar should be final.</p>
